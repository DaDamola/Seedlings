# Seedlings

This repo contains the Pong and Maze minigames of the Seedlings 2DS application that teach high school students how to code through conditionals and loops and object movement, respectively. They were made using C++, tested with the Citra emulator, and run on the 2DS using devkitpro. The m3diaLib libraries provided objects and shapes to render the graphics and develop the game. Pong consists of game objects for the paddles and ball, logic to handle ball-to-paddle and ball-to-wall collisions, a scoreboard, and a series of tutorial popup windows.
